# Folder Synchronization Script

## Description
This Python script facilitates the synchronization of files and directories between a source folder and a replica folder. It compares the contents of the two folders and ensures that they remain identical, copying missing files and directories from the source to the replica, and removing any extraneous items from the replica folder.

## Usage
1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine or download the Python script sync.py directly.
2. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website.
3. Run the Script: Execute the script from the command line, providing the necessary arguments:
   ```
     python sync.py -s source_folder -r replica_folder -i synchronization_interval
   ```
   
    - source_folder: The path to the source folder you want to synchronize.
    - replica_folder: The path to the replica folder where the synchronization will happen.
    - synchronization_interval: The interval in seconds between synchronization.
## Libraries
The script uses the following Python standard libraries:
- os: For interacting with the operating system.
- shutil: For high-level file operations.
- time: For time-related functions.
- argparse: For parsing command-line arguments.
